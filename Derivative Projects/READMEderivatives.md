## Derivatives Advanced Portfolio Computation
# Documents Overview
This repository contains my work for the Derivatives Advanced Portfolio Computation course, an advanced computational finance program focusing on implementing sophisticated pricing engines and risk computation frameworks. The course emphasized bridging theoretical derivatives pricing with production-grade implementation, covering Monte Carlo simulation, automatic differentiation for risk sensitivities, and neural network accelerated pricing.
Working in team, I developed a complete counterparty credit risk system using the PIMPA framework (Pricing Infrastructure for Market and Portfolio Analysis), implementing everything from stochastic process calibration through CVA computation and sensitivity analysis. The coursework progressively built toward creating an institutional-grade pricing and risk platform capable of handling complex multi-asset portfolios.

## Assignment 1: Monte Carlo Framework for Credit Risk
In the first assignment, we built a foundational Monte Carlo simulation framework by calibrating stochastic models (Hull-White for interest rates, Geometric Brownian Motion for FX and equity) and generating correlated multi-dimensional scenarios using Cholesky decomposition. We implemented analytical and Monte Carlo pricers for various derivatives including interest rate swaps and equity European options, valuing them across thousands of scenarios and time steps. The framework computed complete counterparty credit risk metrics including Expected Exposure (EE), Potential Future Exposure (PFE), and demonstrated how collateralization dramatically reduces credit risk through proper netting and margin requirements.

## Assignment 2: Multi-Currency Portfolio Valuation
The second assignment extended our framework to handle foreign exchange derivatives within multi-currency portfolios, requiring careful currency conversion logic and dual interest rate curve handling. We loaded complex portfolios containing FX forward contracts across different currency pairs and maturities, computing mark-to-market values in multiple currencies using simulated FX paths. The results demonstrated the significant impact of collateralization on exposure profiles and highlighted how currency fluctuations affect portfolio valuations in global derivatives portfolios.

## Assignment 3: Automatic Differentiation for Risk Sensitivities
In the third assignment, we implemented automatic differentiation to calculate risk sensitivities of CVA and exposure metrics with respect to all market parameters (spot prices, volatilities, interest rates, and correlations). We constructed a portfolio containing an equity call option (Black-Scholes priced) and an FX up-and-out barrier option (Monte Carlo priced), creating a computationally challenging nested Monte Carlo structure. The implementation traced derivatives through the entire pipeline from market data inputs through stochastic simulation, portfolio aggregation with netting effects, and CVA computation, with specific analysis of how correlation between risk factors (ρ=0.8 vs ρ=-0.8) dramatically affects portfolio risk through diversification effects.

## Assignment 4: Neural Network Accelerated Pricing
The fourth assignment addressed the computational bottleneck of Monte Carlo pricing by training a neural network surrogate model that replicates pricing accuracy at over 100x faster speed. We generated high-quality training data by running Monte Carlo simulations with four-decimal accuracy across thousands of parameter combinations, using normalized inputs (B/K, S₀/K, T, r, σ) for scale-invariance. The trained neural network achieved less than 1% pricing error on 99% of test cases and was seamlessly integrated into our existing portfolio framework, enabling real-time risk management capabilities that would be computationally infeasible with pure Monte Carlo methods.

## Technical Implementation
Throughout these assignments, we built our system using Python with the PIMPA framework providing the foundational infrastructure for market data management, risk factor modeling, and derivative pricing. We leveraged NumPy for efficient numerical operations and Pandas for time series data handling, while implementing custom Monte Carlo engines with proper correlation structure through Cholesky decomposition. The automatic differentiation in assignment three utilized either JAX or PyTorch's autograd capabilities, and the neural network training in assignment four employed TensorFlow with careful attention to regularization and validation procedures.
